# BenefitsServices (Benefits Deduction Calculator)

## Overview

We provide our clients with the ability to pay for their employees’ benefits packages. A portion of these costs are deducted from their paycheck, and we handle that deduction. Please demonstrate how you would code the following scenario:
1.	The cost of benefits is $1000/year for each employee
2.	Each dependent (children and possibly spouses) incurs a cost of $500/year
3.	Anyone whose name starts with ‘A’ gets a 10% discount, employee or dependent
4.	We’d like to see this calculation used in a web application where employers input employees and their dependents, and get a preview of the costs.
#### Please implement a web application based on these assumptions:
1.	All employees are paid $2000 per paycheck before deductions
2.	There are 26 paychecks in a year.
